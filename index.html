<section>
    <p>Hello! I am an upcoming senior at Cornell University's College of Arts and Sciences, pursuing a major in Information Science with a concentration in Data Science and a double minor in Statistics and Business.
    On campus, I am involved in volunteering for Girls Who Code as a coding instructor, working at Cafe Jennie as a barista, and working at Carl Becker House as a house office assistant. 
    Past semesters, I had the opportunity to work under Professor Yian Yin as an undergraduate research assistant where I researched the impact of collective memory on music success and listener behavior. 
    I created plots using Python (pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) to illustrate listener trends and music popularity patterns from the 500+ GB of music listening data from MLHD and MusicBrainz.
    This past summer, I had the opportunity to intern for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alabama, working as a Business Intelligence intern in the Claims department. 
    In this role, I ultized tools like SQL, Tableau, Excel, and SAP Crystal Reports to collect, clean, analyze and visualize Claims data. 
    This summer, I will be interning at Verizon, working as a Solutions Architect intern. 
    I am currently seeking full-time data-related roles starting summer 2026.</p>
